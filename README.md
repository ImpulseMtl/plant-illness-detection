# Plant Illness Detector

## Overview
The Plant Illness Detector is a deep learning tool designed to identify various plant diseases from images. It leverages the power of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of plant images labeled with corresponding illnesses. This model can accurately predict the disease affecting a plant based on a new input image, making it a valuable tool for farmers, gardeners, and researchers in agriculture and botany.

## Features
- Utilizes advanced deep learning techniques and architectures (e.g., ResNet, AlexNet, VGG) to achieve high accuracy in disease identification.
- Supports GPU acceleration for efficient model training and inference.
- Includes data preprocessing and augmentation steps to enhance model robustness.
- Offers the flexibility to fine-tune pre-trained models or train from scratch according to specific needs.
- Implements a confusion matrix for model evaluation, enabling a clear understanding of its performance across different disease categories.

## Requirements
The project requires Python 3.7 or later and relies on several external libraries, including:
- torch
- torchvision
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

These dependencies can be installed using pip:
```
pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas scikit-learn pillow
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset: Organize your plant images and labels according to the expected format. The code assumes a CSV file listing image paths and corresponding disease labels.
2. Configure the model: Select the desired CNN architecture and adjust parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate according to your dataset and computing resources.
3. Train the model: Run the training script to learn from your dataset. The script will automatically split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
4. Evaluate the model: After training, the script will output the model's performance on the validation set. You can further analyze the results using the confusion matrix generated.
5. Predict on new data: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images of plants to identify potential illnesses.
